RedCarded
=========

Introducing **RedCarded**... A simple but powerful app allowing you to express your opinion through the medium of Red and Yellow cards!

This app has the potential to **revolutionise** the way we all communicate...

* Is someone bugging you? Show them the Yellow card!

* At a match and the referee can't hear your (insightful and coherent) shouts? Show him the RED card!
